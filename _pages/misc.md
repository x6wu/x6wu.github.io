**Hello!
Bonjour!
你好！** <br>
This is a page where I ramble on about my non-academic interests which include: 

<details><summary><font size="5"><b>Language Learning</b></font></summary>
<p>
What languages do I speak? Chinese, English and a little bit of French.<br>
What else? Java and C++! :)
I was exposed to English when I was quite young and started learning French in high schoool.

<details><summary><font size="5"><b>Sitcoms</b></font></summary>
<p>
I have been a big fan of sitcoms since I was younger. After all, we could all use some laughter after a long day.
Here is a list of shows I particularly enjoy: <br>

*Growing Pains*<br>
*Brooklyn 99*<br>
*Modern Family*<br>
*Friends*<br>
*Silicon Valley*<br>
*Veep*<br>
*30 Rock*<br>
*The Mick*<br>
*Superstore*<br>

<details><summary><font size="5"><b>Piano</b></font></summary>
<p>
I recently restarted playing the piano. It has been quite a while since the last time I played.<br>
I try to remind myself of some key points when relearning the piano:<br>
* **Be patient.** It takes time for fingers to regain the strength and flexibility they used to have. There is not much I can do to rush the process.<br>
* **Warm up with finger exercises.** I start each practice session with scales and arpeggios or finger exercises from Hannon before playing pieces.<br>
* **Keep an eye on posture.** I find it hard to relax my shoulder when playing and notice backpain after practicing. So I pay close attention to my posture.<br>
* **Don't be discouraged.** It is sometimes frustrating to hear myself play especially when I know I could do better before. But I am returning to piano for fun. So I treat myself a litte bit when I see myself making progress to keep me going.<br>
If you are considering picking up piano again, hopefully you will find these tips somewhat helpful. Have fun!
