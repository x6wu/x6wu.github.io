I am graduating from UC San Diego this June with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
Previously, I interned at [Amazon Pay](https://pay.amazon.com/us/) in Seattle and had a great time.
Upon graduation, I will be moving to Mountain View, CA and joining Google's Product Infrastructure team as Software Engineer.

I currently work at Professor [Tajana Rosing](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/)'s [lab](https://seelab.ucsd.edu/) as Undergraduate Research Assistant with a focus on hyperdimensional computing.

Aside from Computer Science, I am also interested in learning languages and very much enjoy sitcoms. 
Recently, I restarted playing classical piano pieces after eight years.
